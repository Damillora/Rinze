        <h2>My Review</h2>
        <blockquote>
            My take on it? Give it some time. AAside is actually quite
            aesthetically polished, it has stand-out features, and the rhythm
            gameplay is okay. However, there are definitely valid concerns and
            missing features that I understand can be a game-breaker for some.
