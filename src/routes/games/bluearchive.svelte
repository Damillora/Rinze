        <h2>My Review</h2>
        <blockquote>
            In conclusion, Blue Archive is one of those games that I would
            actually play daily. While the gameplay is all familiar, it doesn't
            screw it up either. I also have grown attached to the students cast,
            and it is a reason for me to continue playing. However, its series
            of early problems and maintenances does hurt it a little.
            Personally, I really don't find much problems playing the game, but
            your mileage might vary, and if you find its early problems too
            much, please wait a little longer.
