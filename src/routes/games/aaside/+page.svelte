			<h2>My Review</h2>
			<blockquote>
				My take on it? Give it some time. AAside is actually quite aesthetically polished, it has
				stand-out features, and the rhythm gameplay is okay. However, there are definitely valid
				concerns and missing features that I understand can be a game-breaker for some.
